# 🌈 GAYBOOK — A Cozy Queer Social Network (Offline Prototype)

**GAYBOOK** is a creative, expressive, and safe social platform made for the LGBTQIA+ community — by a queer creator who wanted something softer, truer, and gentler than mainstream social media. Inspired by the early internet, Facebook’s structure, and MySpace’s creativity — GAYBOOK combines it all with full queer soul.

🖼️ **Demo:** Fully offline site (HTML + CSS only) — no server required  
🔐 **Privacy-first:** Works without tracking, databases, or signups  
🧠 **Built with love by:** Gulp (they/them), a queer artist, dreamer, and digital rebel
